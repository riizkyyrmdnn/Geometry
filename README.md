# Geometry
This repository contains 3 programming languages, namely C, C++ and C#. Each file has different code but has the same output. The contents of all the files in this repository are about calculating the volume of geometric in each school. However, this time it uses a programming language to find the volume in an accurate way.

# About
Question: Create a program to calculate the volume of a flat shape using a programming language. Create a number selection for the user to select his destination.
the volume of the building space that must exist. (Total 8):
1. cube
2. beam
3. ball
4. tube
5. cone
6. pyramid
7. prism
8. circle

# Conclusion
The #include header used in C and C++ is <math>. Each method contains a title according to your choice. There are a total of 8 options in the program.
